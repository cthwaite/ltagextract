\subsection{Parsing with head information}

Our plan is to extract the elementary trees for a TAG from a treebank.
Since our corpus lacks phrase structure information, we ran an
off-the-shelf parser on it. The parser that we used for this task is
the Stanford parser.

At the outset, we had plans to use both the phrase structure and
dependency parses that the Stanford parser could produce. Previous
research has shown that having a dependency parse facilitates the task
of determining headedness, which is usually a subtask of elementary
tree extraction.

Finally, we have found a simpler way of getting the head information
directly in the phrase structure parse trees through a command line
switch in the Stanford parser.


Furthermore, the Stanford parser offers two pre-trained models for
parsing English, an unlexicalized one and a lexicalized one. We have
done the parsing using both of them and try to review their
performance. Their outputs were significantly different and both
performed their own idiosyncratic errors. We judged which of these
errors would likely be more harmful to the following grammar
extraction process and decided to stick with the output of the
unlexicalized parser (though the result of the unlexicalized parsing
almost as just as bad as that of the lexicalized one).

\subsection{Conjunction resolving}

When we started working on the manual alignment with our self-enforced
constraint to produce only contiguous groups (see section
\ref{sec:sem-annot}), one of the difficulties we faced was
coordination. Consider the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
Electrogenic pumps, which consist of a hydrophobic amino acid,
a polar amino acid and a monomer, create  membrane potential.

(KBGEN-INPUT 
    :TRIPLES (
            (|Electrogenic-Pump21300| |has-part| |Monomer21323|)
            (|Electrogenic-Pump21300| |has-part| |Polar-Amino-Acid21291|)
            (|Electrogenic-Pump21300| |has-part| |Hydrophobic-Amino-Acid21290|)
            (|Create21297| |agent| |Electrogenic-Pump21300|)
            (|Create21297| |result| |Membrane-Potential21299|))
    :INSTANCE-TYPES (
            (|Monomer21323| |instance-of| |Monomer|)
            (|Polar-Amino-Acid21291| |instance-of| |Polar-Amino-Acid|)
            (|Hydrophobic-Amino-Acid21290| |instance-of| |Hydrophobic-Amino-Acid|)
            (|Electrogenic-Pump21300| |instance-of| |Electrogenic-Pump|)
            (|Create21297| |instance-of| |Create|)
            (|Membrane-Potential21299| |instance-of| |Membrane-Potential|)))
\end{verbatim}

How should the group that contains the word \emph{consists} look like?
It takes an indirect object starting with \emph{of}, so we make
\emph{of} part of the same group. Since this verb is the head of a
relative clause that modifies an NP, we would like to have the first
comma and the word \emph{which} in the same group as well. So far so
good, we have a contiguous group, ``\emph{, which consists of}''. The
set of triples that corresponds to this group is the set of the three
triples with the \textbf{has-part} relation.

So far so good (omitting the final comma, that is). But now we have
trouble when we look at the object of \emph{consists}. To what group
should the comma and the conjunction \emph{and} belong, i.e. what
semantics correspond to them and only to them?

To resolve this issue, we have developed a tool to reify the
coordination structures within the triples themselves.

In our first approach, our program would look for every instance where
one entity was in the same relation with multiple entities, such as
above, and converted the triples to the following:

\begin{verbatim}
:TRIPLES (
        (|Coordination2085| |coordinates| |Monomer21323|)
        (|Coordination2085| |coordinates| |Polar-Amino-Acid21291|)
        (|Coordination2086| |coordinates| |Coordination2085|)
        (|Coordination2086| |coordinates| |Hydrophobic-Amino-Acid21290|)
        (|Electrogenic-Pump21300| |has-part| |Coordination2086|)
        (|Create21297| |agent| |Electrogenic-Pump21300|)
        (|Create21297| |result| |Membrane-Potential21299|))
\end{verbatim}

In this approach, we build a very specific kind of binary tree which
covers the coordinated entities (the generated tree is specific in
that it always leans to the right, so it looks more like a linked
list). Here, one \textbf{Coordination} entity,
\textbf{Coordination2085}, subsumes the \textbf{Monomer21323} and the
\textbf{Polar-Amino-Acid21291}. This coordination corresponds to the
conjunction \emph{and}. The second coordination connects another
entity, the \textbf{Hydrophobic-Amino-Acid21290}, to the previously
formed \textbf{Coordination2085}. The resulting
\textbf{Coordination2086} can then serve as the singular object to the
verb \emph{consists}. Now, all of the NP coordinating constructs
(commas and \emph{and}) are easily accounted for. They form singleton
groups that are aligned to a pair of \textbf{coordinates} relations.

Once we made the switch from contiguous groups, we revised our
approach to coordination. Instead of making this hierarchy of
coordination constructs, we just create a single \textbf{Coordination}
entity which encapsulates all of the coordinated entities directly.
Obviously, this would not have been possible for coordinations of more
than 2 constituents using only contiguous groups, since we would not
to place two non-adjacent conjunction markers into one group.

The upsides of this new approach are that it reduces the complexity of
the newly added triples and that it does not overgenerate like the
last approach, which would end up extracting two elementary trees for
conjunction (one for comma and one for \emph{and}), but would not be
able to distinguish between them and use them properly. The only
downside of the new approach is that it needs to learn different
elementary trees for each different arity of conjunction present in
the corpus. However, since the number of coordinated constituents is
always between 2 and 4 in our corpus, this is a non-issue.

Here is the above example, now rendered using the new coordination
aggregation rules:

\begin{verbatim}
    :TRIPLES (
            (|Electrogenic-Pump21300| |has-part| |Coordination2015|)
            (|Coordination2015| |coordinates| |Monomer21323|)
            (|Coordination2015| |coordinates| |Polar-Amino-Acid21291|)
            (|Coordination2015| |coordinates| |Hydrophobic-Amino-Acid21290|)
            (|Create21297| |agent| |Electrogenic-Pump21300|)
            (|Create21297| |result| |Membrane-Potential21299|))
\end{verbatim}

The code for performing the former aggregation method is still present
in the aggregation program, but is no longer used (see function
\texttt{coordinate-objects-list}). Switching to the new method was
just a matter of writing a new function,
\texttt{coordinate-objects-flat}, and calling that one instead of the
former.
